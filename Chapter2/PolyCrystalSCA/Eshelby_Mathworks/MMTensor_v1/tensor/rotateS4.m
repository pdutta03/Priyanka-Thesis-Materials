% function C = rotateS4(C, R)
%
% Rotate symmetric fourth order tensor C such that its coefficients become
% those relative to the axis system represented by the columns of R.
%
% C: 6 x 6 matrix representing a symmetric 4th order tensor in matrix notation.
% R: 3 x 3 matrix of which the columns represent the new basis vectors.
