% function F = fabric_tensor_from_decomposition(D2, D4)
%
% Return the fabric tensor of the second kind F that corresponds to 
% fabric tensors D2 and D4 of the third kind.
%
% Returns a 6x1 vector containing F corresponding to D2 if D4 is not specified.
% Returns a 6x6 matrix containing F corresponding to D2 and D4 otherwise.
